                    Swagger has been honing their original brand of Celtic music at festivals and concert halls across the United States since 2007. Well known for their high-energy stage performances and catchy original songs, Swagger’s music is the expected Irish celebration of drink, mischief, and music, which also dares to explore oppression and take an emigrant’s perspective on the virtues and vices of the Irish-American culture.

                    Swagger has released 4 studio albums, Trouble on the Green (2008), The Grave, (2010) America Land (2013) & (2017) Gypsy Road. The band has shared stages with The Young Dubliners, Brother, Albanach, Carlos Jones, The English Beat, Andy Frasco, Eric Dodge, and Howard Jones, just to name a few.

                    Swagger’s line up is as varied in their influences as they are in their origins. Calling on their musical backgrounds in rock, ska, funk, jazz, classical, bluegrass, and country, the band is constantly writing new material and changing up their offerings from festival to festival. Their musicianship and live performances give their audiences a truly complete entertainment experience to remember.
